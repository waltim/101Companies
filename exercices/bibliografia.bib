It should be noted that the Guide does not purport to define the body of knowledge but rather to serve as a compendium and guide to the knowledge that has been developing and evolving over the past four decades. Now in Version 3.0, the Guides 15 knowledge areas summarize generally accepted topics and list references for detailed information. The editors for Version 3.0 of the SWEBOK Guide are Pierre Bourque (cole de technologie suprieure (TS), Universit du Qubec) and Richard E.

abstract = {The amount of time and expense spent debugging, customizing, updating, and maintaining software far outstrips the amount spent buying it. This book provides a simple and straightforward introduction to software maintenance activities that work. It is the first book to cover software transition--the process of moving the product from developer to maintainer. Written by one of the world's foremost experts on software maintenance, it draws on real world case studies to explore basic do's and don'ts, IEEE and ISO requirements, organizational issues, and the often sticky issue of metrics. Other topics addressed include object-oriented software and client/server software, corporate education and training programs, creative cost controls, and more.}

With Java 8's functional features you can now write more concise code in less time, and also automatically benefit from multicore architectures. It's time to dig in!Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.About the BookEvery new version of Java is important, but Java 8 is a game changer. Java 8 in Action is a clearly written guide to the new features of Java 8. It begins with a practical introduction to lambdas, using real-world Java code. Next, it covers the new Streams API and shows how you can use it to make collection-based code radically easier to understand and maintain. It also explains other major Java 8 features including default methods, Optional, CompletableFuture, and the new Date and Time API. This book is written for programmers familiar with Java and basic OO programming.

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the research results of an ongoing technology transfer project carried out in cooperation between the University of Salerno and a small software company. The project is aimed at developing and transferring migration technology to the industrial partner. The partner should be enabled to migrate monolithic multi-user COBOL legacy systems to a multi-tier Web-based architecture. The assessment of the legacy systems of the partner company revealed that these systems had a very low level of decomposability with spaghetti-like code and embedded control flow and database accesses within the user interface descriptions. For this reason, it was decided to adopt an incremental migration strategy based on the reengineering of the user interface using Web technology, on the transformation of interactive legacy programs into batch programs, and the wrapping of the legacy programs. A middleware framework links the new Web-based user interface with the Wrapped Legacy System. An Eclipse plug-in, named MELIS (migration environment for legacy information systems), was also developed to support the migration process. Both the migration strategy and the tool have been applied to two essential subsystems of the most business critical legacy system of the partner company. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In industry, enterprises have many software systems to be modernized and made available as added-value services. Identification of migration strategies and practices for service engineering is critical for successful legacy migration, and SOA adoption in industrial setting. This paper presents the results of an interview survey on the migration strategies in industry. The purpose of this paper is twofold: 1) to discover the migration strategies that industrial practice adopts 2) to identify the benefits of making such strategies explicit. Results of the survey have been analyzed in terms of migration activities and the available knowledge assets. As a result, we generalize the practice of industrial migration into a Lean &amp; Mean SOA migration strategy. In addition, the uses of the strategy pinpoint promising industry-relevant research directions.},
